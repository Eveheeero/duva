    Note over A,B : At this point, A and B<br>Both manages full range of data<br>Let's say from 0..10000
    
    C1 --> A: connection established
    C2 --> B: connection established

    C2 ->> B: Cluster Meet A

    B -->> B : Block requests
    B ->> A : Join cluster
    A -->> A: Block requests
    A -->> A: Rearrange tokens

    note over A,B : Both A and B WILL NOT<br>process write operations

    A ->> B : Notify number of partitions and its number of keys to be sent from A to B
    B -->> B : Internally store number paritions and keys to receive from each shard  



    
    par notify cluster peers
    A --) B : Notify token map update
    and notify connected clients
    A --) C1 : Notify token map update
    end

    Note over A,B: Now, A and B have disjoint<br>token ranges<br>0..5000 and 5001..10000 respectively

    critical 
        A ->> B: Migrate data (batch)

        par
            Note left of A: Point-in-time snapshot is required<br>So we don't need to full migrate logs
            A -->> A: Snaphsot and drop logs
        and 
            B -->> B: Deduct number of keys to be received from partition A
        end
    end


    Note over B : B expects keys to be sent<br>from all the partitions(not only from A)
    
    opt If all key arrived
        B -->> B: Snapshot and drop logs
        B -->> B: Unblock write operations
    end

    A -->> A: Unlock pending requests
    alt Request's key is in A's range
        A ->> A: Process request
        A -->> C1: Response
    else Request's key is in B's range
        A -->> C1: (Moved) error
    end




    B --) C2 : Notify token map update
    B -->> B: Unlock pending requests

    alt Request's key is in B's range
        B ->> B: Process request
        B -->> C2: Response
    else Request's key is in A's range
        B -->> C2: (Moved) error
