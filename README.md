### Why the Actor model?
Designed to handle concurrent, distributed, and scalable systems, it models independent units of computation (actors) that communicate solely via message passing. 
It offers several advantages, and the following is a non-exhaustive list of pros
- High concurrency: Systems requiring thousands or millions of lightweight concurrent entities.
- Event-driven architecture: Applications that rely on asynchronous event processing.
- Distributed systems: Systems spanning multiple servers or nodes.
- Fault tolerance: Systems where reliability and recovery from failure are critical.

### Conventions Used in This Project
`-er` or `-Actor` postfix are used in this project to denote it works as either transient or long-running actor


### Features
The following features have been implemented so far:

- Core Commands inspired by Redis
    - SET: Store a key-value pair.
        - Expiration: Set a time-to-live (TTL) for keys.
    - GET: Retrieve the value associated with a key.
    - KEYS (with pattern matching): Retrieve keys matching specific patterns.
    - SAVE: dump data to the designated file path
    - EXISTS
    - DEL
    - INCR
    - DECR
    - ...
    

- Advanced Features
    - Auto Deletion: Automatically remove expired keys.
    - Local Sharding: Efficiently manage data distribution across local actors.
    - Configuration Settings: Customize server behavior with adjustable configurations.
    - Persistence:
        - Dump data into an rdb file (similar to Redisâ€™ dump.rdb).
        - Append Only File

### Diagrams
#### Client request control
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor C as Client
    participant CC as ClientRequestController
    participant Stream
    participant CA as CacheActor
    participant Config as ConfigManager
    
    
    loop wait for connection
        activate CC
        C ->> CC: Make Stream
        CC --) Stream : Spawn Stream
        deactivate CC    
    end

    loop 
        Stream --)+ Stream: wait & receive request
        rect rgb(108, 161, 166)    
            alt cache
                Stream -) CA: route request
                CA -) Stream: return response
            else config
                Stream -) Config: route request
                Config -) Stream: return response
            end
                Stream -)- Stream: send response
            
        end
    end

```

#### Clustering
```mermaid

sequenceDiagram
    participant s as Leader    
    actor Cache
    actor Config
    actor Cluster
    actor peer_listener
    
    actor client_listener
    participant Follower
    actor follower_listener

    par 
        s-->>Cache: spawn
    and 
        s-->>Config: spawn
    and 
        s-->>Cluster: spawn
        Cluster --> Cluster : send heartbeat
        Note right of Cluster : Cluster periodically sends heartbeat to peers 
    and
        s -->>client_listener:spawn
        
    and 
        Follower -->> follower_listener: spawn 
        Note right of Follower : Follower also listens for incoming peer connections
    and 
        s-->>peer_listener: spawn
        loop 
            Follower -->>+ peer_listener: bind 
            peer_listener -->- Follower: threeway handshake
            peer_listener -->> Follower : disseminate peer infomation
            peer_listener -->>+ Cluster : pass stream
            Cluster -->>- Cluster : add peer
        end
        
  
    end

```

#### Synchronization on connection
There are quite a few scenarios related to this. For this, take a look at the diagram.
The following is the partial sync scenario on startup:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant L as Leader
    participant F as Follower
    participant SF as Second Follower
    L ->> L: Save Empty Dump with (Id, Peer Identifier)
    F ->> L: Connect
    L ->> F: Receive Snapshot
    F ->> F: Save Dump from Leader
    SF ->> L: Connect
    L ->> SF: Receive Snapshot
    SF ->> SF: Save Dump from Leader
    L ->> L: append entry * 5
    L ->> F: Replicate
    L ->> SF: Replicate
    
    L ->> L: Create Snapshot (until hwm 5)
    L ->> F: Create Snapshot 
    L ->> SF : Create Snapshot

    break
        SF --> SF: Second Follower Crashed
    end

    L ->> L: append entry * 3
    L ->> F: Replicate

    SF ->> L: Connect (replid: leader_repl_id, hwm:5, term: 1)
    L ->> SF: Receive Snapshot (hwm: 5)
```


#### Partial synchronization for reconcilation
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Actor C as Client
    participant L as Leader
    participant F as Follower
    participant SF as Second Follower
    
    Note over L,SF : Connection established

    C->>L: set x 1 (log 1)

    par 
        L->>F: replicate x 1
    and
        L->>SF: replicate x 1
    end

    C->>L: set y 1 (log 2)

    break
        SF --x SF: crash
    end
    L->>F: replicate y 1

    L -x SF: replicate y 1


    SF -->> SF: recover
    SF -->> L: Join
    L -->> L: store watermark for Second Follower (1)


    L --> L : create append entries individually for each follower
    par 
        L ->> SF : send AppendRPC WITH log 2
    and
        L ->> F : send AppendRPC WITHOUT log
    end

```

#### Push-based topology change notification
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor C as Client
    participant L as Leader
    participant F as Followers

    C --> L : Connection established
    L ->> L : Register client connection to topology change watcher
    
    F --> L : Peer Connection made
    
    L ->> C : Notify client of topology change
    C ->> C : Update topology


    break Leader failed
        L --x L : Crash
        C --x L : request
    end
    
    loop
        C ->> F : Are you leader?
        F ->> C : No
        C ->> F : Are you leader?
        F ->> C : Yes    
    end
    C ->> C : Reset leader information
    C ->> F : retry request


```

#### RYOW consistency guarantee (follower reads)
This ensures that clients always see their most recent writes, even when reading from followersâ€”providing a smooth, consistent user experience without unnecessary load on the leader.

This ensures that clients never read stale data after a successful write, improving both performance and consistency without requiring all reads to go to the leader. With this enhancement, Project X delivers stronger guarantees, lower latency, and improved scalabilityðŸš€.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor C as Client
    participant L as Leader
    participant F as Follower

    note over L,F : X:1<br>hwm:1

    C->>L: write(X,5)
    note over L : X:5<br>hwm:2
    note over F : X:1<br>hwm:1
    L->>C: hwm:2
    C->>F: read(X,hwm=2)
    F--)F: wait for latest hwm
    L->>F: write(X,5,hwm=2)
    note over F : X:5<br>hwm:2
    F->>C: X:5
```

### Strong consistency with Raft

#### Election (normal flow)
There are two timeout settings which control elections.
- `Election timeout` : amount of time a follower waits until becoming a candidate, randomized to be between 150-300ms
  - After elecction timeout, the follower becomes a candidate and start a new election term. In this case system:
    - increases value `term` by 1
    - starts counting voting(which is from 1 as it votes for itself)
    - sends `Request Vote` messages to other nodes
  - If the receiving node hasn't voted YET in this term, it votes for the candidate and resets its election timeout(and increase its `term` by 1 and mark it's voting state for candidate -> `Vote for` state).
  - Once a candiate gets a majority of votes, it becomes a leader. 
  
- The leader begins sending out `Append Entries` messages to its followers, the interval of which is specified by the `heartbeat timeout`
  - Followers get `Append Entries` and then change state from `Vote for: {node identifier}` ->  `Leader : {leader_node identifier}`
  - The election term continues until a follower stops receiving heartbeats and becomes a candidate


#### Election in split brain
- If two candidates occur at the same time, it causes race. Let's say we have two candidates(A,B) and two potential followers(C,D).
- `Request Vote` arrives at two node(C,D) 
  - C votes for A
  - D votes for B
- Now, each candidate has 2 votes and can receive no more for this term.
- Then EVERY NODES wait one more round of `election timeout` and send `Request vote` again.



### Failure Detection
The system doesn't cooridnate important decisions using the protocol using eventually consistent like gossip dissemination. 
However, general information, such as node liveness can be efficiently propagated using such an algorithm.
Duva achieves failure detection using `Gossip mechanism` which may evolve into a hybrid gossip algorithm based on `Plumtree`.
Heartbeat frequency and timeout period before considering a node as failed are highly configurable:
```sh
cargo run -- --hf 100 --ttl 1500
```
Here `hf` means heartbeat is sent every 100ms.
If a peer known to the given node has not sent a heartbeat within 1500ms (ttl), it is considered dead and removed from the list.



### Getting Started
#### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version)



Build the project:

```sh
cargo run
```

If you have dump file, and you can load them up on start-up,
```sh
cargo run -- --dir directory-path --dbfilename filename
```



### Protocol
This server supports the RESP Protocol, enabling interaction with clients in a familiar Redis-like manner.

### Roadmap
Future enhancements will include:

- Distributed sharding
- Replication
    - TransactionLog
- Pub/Sub support
- More advanced data types (e.g., lists, sets, hashes)
- Write-through / read-through support
